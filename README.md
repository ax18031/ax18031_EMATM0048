SDPA Coursework 

This is a repository for the 100% coursework assessment of the Software Development Programming and algorithms unit. 
There are three parts to this assessment and will be uploaded onto this repository each time I change something.

Part 1: In this folder I have my Python code and CSV file of a online customer banking system. CSV file contains information about customers that have been inputted on the system. The other files form the code, including a file called main.py which runs the online banking system. It is a Python ran online banking system that relies on OOP. 

Part 2: In this folder I have a Jupyter notebook which solves the problem of sorting house numbers in a particular order. The order in which we needed to sort the list of numbers by starting with the highest odd number descending to the lowest odd number then the lowest even number to the highest even number. Before the end of the document, I include examples of the algorithm working on a set of lists that I created/were in the worksheet. At the end of this notebook, I discuss the complexity of my sorting algorithm.

Part 3: This notebook looks at the data analysis of a data set about the world happiness index in 2020. I explore statistics, machine learning algorithms and regression models, including drawing hypothesis and using mathematics to prove or disprove them. This notebook contains many diagrams and graphs that represent findings in the data.
